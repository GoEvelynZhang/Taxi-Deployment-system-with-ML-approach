# Taxi Deployment System with ML approach
Abstractâ€”This projects explores a strategic taxi deployment decision model based on two prediction models on taxi demand and traffic congestion. In this project, we used a stacking assembling approach to assemble a bunch of base prediction model for better prediction accuracy and reduced overfit performance. Using the dataset in Haikou, Hainan province, we eventually achieved test MSE of 0.1230 and 0.7927 in order demand and congestion prediction, respectively.
