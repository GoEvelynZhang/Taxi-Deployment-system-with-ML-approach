Abstract—This paper explores a strategic taxi deployment
decision model based on two prediction models on taxi de-
mand and traffic congestion. In this paper, we used a stacking
assembling approach to assemble a bunch of base prediction
model for better prediction accuracy and reduced overfit
performance. Using the dataset in Haikou, Hainan province,
we eventually achieved test MSE of 0.1230 and 0.7927 in order
demand and congestion prediction, respectively.
